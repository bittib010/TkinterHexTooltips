# TkinterHexTooltips
 Analysing and learning about the deeper levels of filesystems.
 
 The idea of this app was to make studies a bit more interesting. Reading about filesystem on a hex level was kinda intimidating and it felt very unorganized. Because, you read a few bytes, and then there are two pages of information before the next few bytes are explained. I came up with the idea of packing the information into each byte and that the information belonging to the part the cursor is hovering will pop-up in another widget besides. I would love to expand this idea going forth. 
 
 Here is a few screenshots:
 
 The red part is being hovered. Currently, very little information is being showed. This will be developed further.
